Create simple Markdown-driven blogs.

## About

I wanted to learn the JavaScript stack&mdash;specifically [MEAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN)&mdash;and blog what I've learn for reference. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) was the obvious choice to host the blog, but in the end I decided to [eat my own dog food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) and build one&mdash;it'll be more fun and challenging then another [Todo app](http://todomvc.com/).

## Notes
### Initial checkin
- Installed Node.js and Express
- `npm init` to generate `package.json`
- [`express-generator`](http://expressjs.com/guide.html#executable) to create skeleton app
